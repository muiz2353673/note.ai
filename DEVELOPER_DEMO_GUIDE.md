# 🔧 Developer Demo Features Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The demo features in Noted.AI are now **developer-only** and will only be visible when you're in development mode. This ensures that regular users don't see demo controls while still allowing developers to showcase the application effectively.

## 🚀 How to Access Demo Features

### **Automatic Access (Development Mode)**
- Demo features are automatically available when running the app in development mode (`npm run dev`)
- They will appear on both the landing page and authenticated pages
- No additional setup required

### **Manual Toggle**
If you need to manually control demo features:

1. **Enable Dev Mode**: 
   - Click the "Dev Mode" button (top-left corner, gray button with ⚙️ icon)
   - The button will turn green (🔧 icon) when active
   - Demo features will appear immediately

2. **Disable Dev Mode**:
   - Click the "Dev Mode" button again
   - The button will turn gray (⚙️ icon)
   - Demo features will disappear

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Development Mode Detection**
The demo features use a sophisticated check that includes:
- `NODE_ENV === 'development'` environment check
- `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` hostname check
- Optional `devMode` localStorage flag for manual control

### **Files Modified**
- `client/src/utils/devMode.ts` - Development mode utilities
- `client/src/components/DevToggle.tsx` - Developer toggle component
- `client/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` - Added demo components with dev check
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Added demo components with dev check

### **Demo Components**
- `DemoMode.tsx` - Main demo control panel
- `DemoTour.tsx` - Interactive feature walkthrough
- `DemoAnalytics.tsx` - Simulated analytics dashboard
- `DemoCredentials.tsx` - Account credential manager
