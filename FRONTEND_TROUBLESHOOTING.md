# Frontend Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Can't Save, Edit, or See Notes

### ✅ Backend Status: WORKING
- ✅ Server is running on port 5002
- ✅ Database is connected
- ✅ Notes API is functional
- ✅ Authentication is working
- ✅ Test notes exist in database

### 🔍 Frontend Issues & Solutions

#### 1. **Authentication Issue** (Most Likely)
**Problem**: You're not logged in on the frontend
**Solution**: 
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Login with test credentials:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `testpassword123`
3. Or register a new account

#### 2. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**
**Problem**: TypeScript errors preventing compilation
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Fixed: Added proper Note interface
- ✅ Fixed: Typed useState correctly
- ✅ Fixed: Removed unused variable warning

#### 3. **Browser Console Errors**
**Problem**: JavaScript errors in browser
**Solution**:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Check Network tab for failed API calls

#### 4. **API Connection Issues**
**Problem**: Frontend can't connect to backend
**Solution**:
- Ensure both servers are running:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- Check that frontend is on http://localhost:3000
- Check that backend is on http://localhost:5002

### 🚀 Quick Fix Steps

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser** and go to http://localhost:3000

3. **Login** with test credentials:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `testpassword123`

4. **Navigate to Notes** page

5. **Test functionality**:
   - Create a new note
   - Edit existing notes
   - Save changes

### 🔧 If Still Not Working

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Clear browser cache** and localStorage
3. **Restart the development server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Check if you're logged in**:
   - Look for user info in top navigation
   - Check if "Login" button is visible

### 📞 Debug Information

If you're still having issues, please provide:
1. Browser console errors (F12 → Console)
2. Network tab errors (F12 → Network)
3. Current URL you're on
4. Whether you see login/logout buttons in navigation

### 🎯 Expected Behavior

After logging in, you should see:
- ✅ Notes page with existing notes
- ✅ "New Note" button working
- ✅ Ability to edit notes
- ✅ Save functionality working
- ✅ AI features accessible

**Status**: Backend is fully functional. Frontend should work after proper authentication.
