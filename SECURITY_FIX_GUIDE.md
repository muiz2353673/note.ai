# 🔒 SECURITY FIX GUIDE - API Key Leak Resolution

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Your OpenAI API Key Was Exposed

Your OpenAI API key was found in your Git history and has been disabled by OpenAI. This guide will help you secure your project and get back up and running.

## ✅ Immediate Actions Completed

1. **Created `.gitignore`** - Prevents future API key leaks
2. **Removed .env files from Git tracking** - Your sensitive files are no longer tracked
3. **Identified the exposed key** - Found in Git history

## 🔧 Required Actions

### 1. Create New OpenAI API Key
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a new API key
3. **NEVER share this key publicly**

### 2. Update Your Environment Files

**Server Environment (`server/.env`):**
```bash
# Add this line to your server/.env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_new_openai_api_key_here
```

**Client Environment (`client/.env`):**
```bash
# Add this line to your client/.env file:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5002/api
```

### 3. Commit Security Changes
```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "🔒 Add .gitignore to prevent API key leaks"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Test Your Application
```bash
# Start your server
cd server && npm start

# Start your client (in another terminal)
cd client && npm start
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Never Commit Sensitive Data
- ✅ Use `.env` files for secrets
- ✅ Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Use environment variables in production
- ❌ Never commit API keys to Git
- ❌ Never share API keys in code

### Environment Variable Management
- Use `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` in Node.js
- Use `REACT_APP_VARIABLE_NAME` in React
- Keep `.env.example` files for documentation
- Use different keys for development/production

### Production Deployment
- Set environment variables in your hosting platform
- Use secure key management services
- Rotate keys regularly
- Monitor API usage for anomalies

## 🔍 How the Leak Happened

The API key was committed to Git history in one of these ways:
1. Direct commit of `.env` file
2. Hardcoded in source code
3. Committed in documentation or examples

## 📋 Checklist

- [ ] Create new OpenAI API key
- [ ] Update `server/.env` with new key
- [ ] Update `client/.env` if needed
- [ ] Commit `.gitignore` changes
- [ ] Test application functionality
- [ ] Review all documentation for exposed keys
- [ ] Set up production environment variables

## 🆘 If You Need Help

1. Check OpenAI's security documentation
2. Review your Git history for other exposed secrets
3. Consider using a secrets management service
4. Set up automated security scanning

## 🔄 Future Prevention

1. **Pre-commit hooks** - Add hooks to prevent committing secrets
2. **Security scanning** - Use tools like GitGuardian or TruffleHog
3. **Regular audits** - Review your codebase for exposed secrets
4. **Team training** - Ensure all team members understand security practices
